  <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Qualified as a Maître de Conférence in Economics, Oudah Yobom holds a doctorate in Economics which he prepared at the Center for Economics and Sociology Applied to Agriculture and Rural Areas (CESAER), a joint research unit formed by the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food & the Environment (INRAe) and L'Institut Agro of Dijon.
    <p>Overall, he has a university education which has allowed him to build a diversified profile, ranging from microeconomist and macroeconomist, to applied and development economist. This profile led him to know the academic world and to have experience in the world of financial macroeconomics, particularly in a central bank.
    With his spirit of sharing, he has also taught courses in economics & econometrics and led seminars on economics and agricultural policy in developing countries. He also participated in seminars on the issue of climate change, food security and other economic topics bringing together several multidisciplinary actors (FAO, NGOs, research institutions, etc.)
    whose aim is to find strategies for reducing food security and improving the resilience of populations.</p>
    <p>Primarily, its research program is broadly focused on issues of agricultural sustainability with particular emphasis on the econometric and statistical assessment of the effects of climate change on agricultural sectors, particularly agriculture and food security.
    His work focuses on arid and semi-arid countries with an area of expertise including all the countries forming the Sahelian belt (Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia and Sudan), from Senegal to the Horn of Africa. </p>
    <p>As part of a project with the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) and the Energy and Prosperity Chair, he worked on issues of climate and environmental performance of economic sectors.
    In this capacity, he worked on the construction of a climate performance indicator for companies operating in the energy and utilities sector around the world, in particular with the alignment of the portfolio with the Paris scenario of 2° Celsius.
    Thus, studies on the disclosure of information related to climate performance and energy & ecological transition issues are at the center of its work.</p>
    <p>Currently, he is working on the issues of adaptation and resilience of cities and territories to climate change within the framework of the European project CREST "Climate resilient coastal urban infrastructures through to digital twinning" (European funding, ERA-Net Urban Transformation Capacities, 2022 -2025).
    With several partners (municipalities, associations, research institutes, etc.) and researchers, the work focuses on the coastal cities of France (Bordeaux), Norway (Møre og Romsdal) and Poland (Kołobrzeg).</p>
