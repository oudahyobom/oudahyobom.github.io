  <h3>About me </h3>
    <p>Primarily, its research program is broadly focused on issues of agricultural sustainability with particular emphasis on the econometric and statistical assessment of the effects of climate change on agricultural sectors, particularly agriculture and food security.
    His work focuses on arid and semi-arid countries with an area of expertise including all the countries forming the Sahelian belt (Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia and Sudan ), from Senegal to the Horn of Africa. </p>
    <p>As part of a project with the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) and the Energy and Prosperity Chair, he worked on issues of climate and environmental performance of economic sectors.
    In this capacity, he worked on the construction of a climate performance indicator for companies operating in the energy and utilities sector around the world, in particular with the alignment of the portfolio with the Paris scenario of 2° Celsius.
    Thus, studies on the disclosure of information related to climate performance and energy & ecological transition issues are at the center of its work.</p>
    <p>Currently, he is working on the issues of adaptation and resilience of cities and territories to climate change within the framework of the European project CREST "Climate resilient coastal urban infrastructures through to digital twinning" (European funding, ERA-Net Urban Transformation Capacities, 2022 -2025).
    With about 25 other researchers, the work focuses on coastal cities in France, Norway and Poland.</p>
