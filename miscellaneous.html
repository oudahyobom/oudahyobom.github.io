    </p>
    In this report, we have studied the instruments used by the BEAC for the implementation of its monetary policy. It uses them to convey its policy, regulate and supervise the banking market in the sub-region.
    The National Directorates of the Central Bank in the six countries are responsible for applying the monetary decisions emanating from the Central Directorate based in Yaoundé in the Cameroonian capital.
    Currently, the BEAC does not have the capacity to standardize its monetary policy in the six member countries, because there is a divergence of structure between the countries.
    The instruments used are not suitable for such a policy. Thus, it is appropriate for the BEAC to define good instruments of financial conduct having an impact on the six countries.
    The arrival of new banks on the market should encourage BEAC and COBAC to develop more informative forecasting instruments. Consequently, the CEMAC countries find themselves at an impasse due to the monetary policy trap.
    Private players are not active in the credit market given the inherent risks in this market.

    <li> Oudah Yobom (2016) "Analysis of the rules for granting BEAC assistance to credit institutions", Bank of Central African States.</li> </p>
    With a view to economic recovery, the BEAC intervenes in the banking market to bail out banks in need of liquidity. Chad's financial situation has deteriorated sharply due to the drastic drop in oil prices.
    Accordingly, the Central Bank is agitating through its tenders to maintain monetary stability to enable the eight banking industries present in the country to fulfill their role as financial intermediaries.
    Banking assistance in Chad is at its highest level, as well as in the sub-region. The Chadian economy is the least diversified and strongly correlated to the international situation.
    BEAC's support to credit institutions in Chad remains an important engine for the revival and growth of the country's economy, due to its usefulness of support and its knock-on effect at the macroeconomic level. The classification convention therefore allows credit institutions to offer products to their customers after examining their solvency.
